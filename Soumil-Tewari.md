# Project Name

## Summary

I am trying to build a security device for safety at market places. It would be connected to my Esp32 cam board( already have so not ordering) and track realtime information in market with AI based technology to detect theft and most people seen during the theft so that they could be detected and investigated.

## Plan

I will be writing all the code in Arduino IDE for Esp32 cam and connect it with Raspberry pi where Raspberry pi will detect all the activities and in case of theft reported ,send data directly to Police department and further it can also do data processing of images of same people seen again and again during theft and they would be detected and investigated.
